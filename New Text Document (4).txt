I NEED A PENTESTING PERSPECTIVE AS I AM CONDUCTING A PENTESTING PROGJECCT FOR MY STUDENTS
Absolutely, LiL. Here's a pentesting-oriented breakdown of the RuneHall Telegram channel and its associated promotional ecosystem, tailored for instructional use:

🛡️ Pentesting Perspective: RuneHall.com Telegram Channel
1. Surface-Level Recon
Channel Type: Public Telegram channel promoting Runescape gambling bonuses.

Linked Domain: runehall.com — used for bonus redemption via unique URLs.

Promo Mechanics: Weekly codes with wagering thresholds (e.g., $240–$25,000) tied to in-game currency rewards.

2. Potential Attack Vectors
🧩 Telegram Channel
Phishing Risk: Promo links could redirect to credential-harvesting pages disguised as game login portals.

Malicious Redirects: Telegram posts embed external links (runehall.com/m/b/...) — inspect for obfuscated JavaScript or dynamic redirects.

Social Engineering: Incentivized rewards may lure users into revealing account details or installing unverified plugins.

🌐 RuneHall.com
Bonus Claim Pages: URLs like runehall.com/m/b/WeeklyWR023 suggest dynamic routing — test for:

IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference): Can users manipulate bonus codes or claim others’ rewards?

Open Redirects: Check if parameters allow redirection to third-party domains.

XSS/CSRF: Inspect bonus claim forms or embedded scripts for injection points.

🧠 Behavioral Analytics Angle
Wager Tracking Logic: Claims require proof of wagering (e.g., $25K in 7 days). This implies:

Backend integration with game APIs or user wallets.

Potential for logic flaws in wager validation — fuzz inputs to test thresholds.

Replay attacks if bonus codes are not time-bound or single-use.

3. Infrastructure Fingerprinting
Telegram CDN: Images and emojis served via cdn4.telesco.pe — analyze for metadata leakage or CDN misconfigurations.

Telegram Widgets: Embedded message bubbles and reactions use SVG and JS — inspect for DOM-based XSS or clickjacking.

4. Student Exercise Ideas
🔍 Recon Lab: Use OSINT tools to map the Telegram channel, domain, and promo flow.

🧪 Web App Testing: Simulate bonus claim attempts with Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP.

🧠 Logic Abuse: Design test cases to bypass wagering requirements or reuse codes.

🧼 Sanitization Audit: Inspect Telegram post rendering for emoji-based injection or malformed markup.

If you want, I can help you draft a modular lab sheet or threat model template for your students to work through this ecosystem. Want to go deeper into the backend assumptions or simulate a phishing payload?
