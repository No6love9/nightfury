# NightFury v3.0: Advanced Exploitation Guide

This guide covers the advanced modules and high-pressure techniques implemented in the **NightFury v3.0** framework, specifically optimized for **Runehall.com** operations.

## 1. High-Pressure Installation

To initialize the framework with maximum performance settings, use the new pressure script:

```bash
chmod +x nightfury_install_pressure.sh
sudo ./nightfury_install_pressure.sh
```

This script optimizes system limits, injects all AI dependencies, and prepares the `nightfury_pressure_config.json` for aggressive execution.

## 2. Advanced Runehall Modules

### **Blockchain Analyzer (`runehall_blockchain.py`)**
Used for on-chain intelligence gathering.
- **Usage:** `use exploit/runehall_blockchain`
- **Capabilities:** Wallet clustering, risk scoring, and smart contract vulnerability detection.

### **Exploit Chain Builder (`runehall_chain_builder.py`)**
Automates the transition between reconnaissance and multi-stage exploitation.
- **Usage:** `use exploit/runehall_chain_builder`
- **Logic:** Dynamically constructs paths from OSINT data to account takeover.

### **Vulnerability Correlator (`runehall_vuln_correlator.py`)**
Analyzes multiple low-severity findings to identify critical exploit paths.
- **Usage:** `use exploit/runehall_vuln_correlator`
- **Focus:** Identity mapping and impact escalation.

## 3. Persistence & Privilege Escalation

### **Persistence Engine (`persistence_engine.py`)**
Ensures long-term access using stealthy techniques.
- **Methods:** `systemd` service masquerading, `cron` job injection, and Windows Registry persistence.

### **Auto Privesc (`auto_privesc.py`)**
Automated privilege escalation for Linux and Windows environments.
- **Vectors:** DirtyPipe (CVE-2022-0847), SUID misconfigurations, and Sudo NOPASSWD exploitation.

## 4. Aggressive Console Operations

The `runehall_aggressive_console.py` is the primary interface for maximum-intensity testing. It utilizes the `EXTREME` exploitation level by default, focusing on:
- Auth Bypass
- Bet Manipulation
- Payment System Exploitation
- RNG Prediction

## 5. OPSEC Best Practices

- **Traffic Randomization:** Always enable in `nightfury_pressure_config.json`.
- **Proxy Rotation:** Use `opsec-proxy` quick command to maintain anonymity.
- **Forensic Cleaning:** Run `opsec-clean` after every operation to remove traces.
